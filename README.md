# Custom Ocarina of Time Music Sequences
The .zip here contains the resources required for custom music sequences in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time while using the Ocarina of Time Randomizer.

# Installation
Download [this zip file](https://github.com/DaruniasJoy/OoT-Custom-Sequences/archive/master.zip) and extract it. Then move the contents of the "Music" that was inside that zip file into the "Music" folder in the "data" folder next to the randomizer executable. If done correctly, the Music folder should now have several subfolders in it, each with the name of a different game or series.
